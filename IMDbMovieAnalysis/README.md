# IMDb-Movie-Analysis
We all love watching movies, they are a great source of entertainment, fun, and relaxation. Movies are released all over the world and in many different languages, from all the movies there are some standout (outstanding) movies which we like to watch, there might be many reasons why a movie is outstanding maybe because of its Director, Actor, Actress, Storyline, Screenplay etc. In this project, We will like to measure the greatness of the movie based on several parameters. We will apply different data mining algorithms like Random Forests, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors. We will also be doing Exploratory Data Analysis that has to be done prior to the prediction models.
