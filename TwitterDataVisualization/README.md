# Twitter Data Visualization

## Project Description:
We will collect the live event's online streaming data from Twitter. In this project, we have collected Tweets for College Football Teams and based on those collected Tweets we will analyze the trends of the Football Matches. More the number of tweets for a player/coach more popular he is during the Match. 

**NOTE**: This analysis only gives the *popularity* of the Player/Coach during the Match and not whether the Player is performing *better* or not.

## Technologies:
* Python
* Tweepy API - Twitter Online Streaming API
* Palmetto Cluster - Super Computer at Clemson University
* RShiny - Visualization Tool

## Popularity Measure:
To measure the Popularity of Player/Coach, we have used the *count of tweets in which the Player/Coach was mentioned* during the period of the Event/Match. We have also done the *minute-by-minute analysis* in which we can we can compare how popular a player was during a perticular period of time and we can also compare it with other Player/Coach. 

## Conclusions:
* We have observed that the QuaterBack(QB) was mentioned more than other Players.
* We have observed that the Coach will be mentioned if there was a very good tactical play during the Match.
* The Data Visualization shows that there will a lot of tweets collected during a Touch down or for an Interception.
